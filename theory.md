🧠 Building a Chat App with AI Using PostgreSQL, Flask, and Ollama (RAG with PDF)

🎯 Goal

By the end of this session, you and your audience will:

Understand what Large Language Models (LLMs) are.

Know what RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) is.

Learn how to build a simple Question & Answer chat app using documents and AI.

🧩 What Is an LLM?

Imagine talking to a super-smart assistant that reads billions of books and web pages and gives answers. That's a Large Language Model (LLM).

Example: ChatGPT, Mistral, Gemini, Claude are all LLMs. They can answer questions, write stories, translate languages, and even write code.

💬 What Is RAG?

RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. Instead of making the AI "remember everything," it can:

"Look up" your documents.

"Read" the most relevant ones.

Generate an answer based on them.

Example: You upload a 50-page PDF. You ask: "What is the company refund policy?" — The AI finds that paragraph and explains it in simple terms.

🧱 Components in Our App

1. PostgreSQL + pgvector

PostgreSQL is a powerful open-source database.

pgvector lets us store AI-related data called "embeddings."

2. Sentence Transformers

It converts our text into embeddings — basically numbers representing meaning.

3. Flask

A mini web server written in Python. It powers the backend of our app.

4. Ollama + Mistral

Ollama lets us run powerful LLMs like Mistral on our own computer (no internet or OpenAI needed).

🔄 Flow of the App

User types question ─▶ Flask App ─▶ Looks up similar docs using pgvector ─▶
Combines docs + question ─▶ Sends to Mistral (via Ollama) ─▶ Returns answer to user

💻 Features in Our App

Upload PDF and ask questions about it.

Manually add text and ask questions about it.

See previous questions and answers (chat history).

🧪 Demo Time (Live!)

Open app in browser (http://:5000)

Upload PDF → Wait for "OK"

Ask a question → Get answer from Mistral

Add some custom text → Ask questions about that

🛠 Tech Stack Recap

🐘 PostgreSQL + pgvector for storing content and searching.

🔣 Sentence Transformers for embeddings.

🌐 Flask for handling routes and backend logic.

🧠 Mistral via Ollama for answering questions.

💡 Final Notes

This runs fully offline.

Great for private data and custom chat apps.

Add streaming later for real-time typing effects.

📚 Suggested Enhancements

Add user login.

Highlight the PDF content in responses.

Allow audio or voice queries.
